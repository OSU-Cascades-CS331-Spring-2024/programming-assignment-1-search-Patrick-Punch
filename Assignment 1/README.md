4. The number of times it found the optimal solution (optimal here is measured as â€œfound the best solution out of the four search algorithms)
- When running the test city pairs, the A* algorithm always found the optimal solution. The A* algorithm has the lowest average score at 1097 with the provided data. The next best algorithm is BFS and UCS, with an average of 1373/1377. The biggest differene influencing these algorithms is the weight of the heuristic in the A* algorithm. The UCS algorithm performs on average surprisingly similarly to the BFS Algorithm, which approach the solution with different logic. The worst performing algorithm is DLS, with an average cost of 2538.
